# opencartCartOverrideFix
  Opencart default behaviour is to save cart products when user logs out or leaves website.
  So anytime user logs In , all the items are added back to cart. 
  This causes trouble when user has already added new items into cart and logs In at checkout step.
  Opencart adds all the previous items and thus user's current cart selection is updated which is useless most of the times.
  
  This extension will fix the issue.
